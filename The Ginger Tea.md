## Ginger-Turmeric Tea Recipe (Pressure Cooker Method)

Creating a gallon of extraordinarily healthy ginger-turmeric tea using fresh ingredients in a pressure cooker is both efficient and flavorful. Here's an updated recipe incorporating fresh turmeric and lemon:

### Ingredients:
- 1 gallon (16 cups) water
- 1 cup fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 cup fresh turmeric root, peeled and thinly sliced
- 4 cinnamon sticks
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- Optional: 1 teaspoon ground cardamom or Â½ teaspoon cayenne pepper for added flavor
- Sweetener to taste (e.g., honey, maple syrup, or a sweetener of your choice)
- 2 fresh lemons

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**
   - Peel and thinly slice the fresh ginger and turmeric roots.
   - Gather all spices and measure them accordingly.

2. **Combine Ingredients in the Pressure Cooker:**
   - Place the sliced ginger, turmeric, cinnamon sticks, black peppercorns, and any optional spices into the pressure cooker.
   - Pour in the gallon of water. Ensure you do not exceed the maximum fill line of your pressure cooker.

3. **Pressure Cook:**
   - Secure the lid on the pressure cooker and set the valve to the sealing position.
   - Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes.
   - After the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for about 10-15 minutes, then carefully perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.

4. **Strain and Sweeten:**
   - Open the lid carefully.
   - Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain the tea into a large container to remove the ginger and turmeric slices, along with the spices.
   - Stir in your preferred sweetener while the tea is still warm, adjusting to taste.

5. **Add Lemon Juice:**
   - Once the tea has cooled slightly, add the freshly squeezed lemon juice. Adding lemon juice after cooling helps preserve its vitamin C content and prevents bitterness.

6. **Serve:**
   - Pour the tea into cups.
   - Optionally, garnish with a lemon slice for added flavor and presentation.

### Storage:
Allow the tea to cool to room temperature before transferring it to airtight containers. Refrigerate and consume within one week. You can enjoy it chilled or reheat individual servings as desired.

### Notes:
- Turmeric's active compound, curcumin, is better absorbed when consumed with black pepper and a small amount of fat. Consider enjoying your tea with a splash of coconut milk or another fat-containing addition to enhance absorption.
- Turmeric can stain surfaces and utensils. Handle with care to avoid staining.
- Adjust the quantity of ginger and spices according to your taste preferences. If you prefer a spicier tea, increase the ginger or add cayenne pepper.
