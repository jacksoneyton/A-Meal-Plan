## Grain-Free Vegetable and Legume Stew (Pressure Cooker)

Here's a grain-free stew recipe optimized for pressure cooking, substituting split peas with lentils and chickpeas with dried black beans. This hearty stew incorporates sweet potatoes, canned green chili tomatoes, half an onion, celery, carrots, and bell pepper. Adding cheese as a topping enhances the flavor and adds a creamy texture.

### Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 cup dried black beans, soaked for 4-6 hours and drained
- 1 cup dried lentils, rinsed (no soaking required)
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes with green chilies
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- **Optional toppings:** shredded cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack), chopped fresh cilantro, sliced green onions

### Instructions:

**Sauté Vegetables:**

- Set your pressure cooker to the 'Sauté' function and heat the olive oil.
- Add diced onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until translucent.
- Add minced garlic, chopped carrots, celery, and bell pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes until vegetables begin to soften.

**Add Sweet Potatoes and Spices:**

- Stir in diced sweet potatoes, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Cook for 2 minutes, allowing the spices to become fragrant.

**Incorporate Black Beans, Lentils, and Broth:**

- Add the soaked and drained black beans and rinsed lentils to the pot.
- Pour in the vegetable broth and canned diced tomatoes with green chilies (including their juices). Stir to combine.

**Pressure Cook:**

- Secure the lid on the pressure cooker and ensure the valve is set to the sealing position.
- Set the pressure cooker to high pressure for 15 minutes.
- Once cooking is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.

**Season and Serve:**

- After releasing the pressure, open the lid carefully.
- Season the stew with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
- Ladle the stew into bowls and top with shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, and sliced green onions if desired.

### Notes:

- **Soaking Black Beans:** Soaking black beans for 4-6 hours before cooking reduces the cooking time and promotes even cooking. If you prefer not to soak, increase the pressure cooking time to 20-25 minutes.
- **Lentils:** Lentils do not require soaking and cook relatively quickly under pressure.
- **Consistency:** If the stew is too thick after cooking, you can add additional vegetable broth or water to reach your desired consistency.
- **Flavor Enhancements:** For added depth of flavor, consider adding a bay leaf during cooking or a splash of apple cider vinegar before serving.

Enjoy your grain-free, hearty vegetable and legume stew!
