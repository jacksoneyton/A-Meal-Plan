# L. Reuteri Yogurt Recipe

## Ingredients

- **1 quart (1 liter) of half-and-half cow’s milk**  
  *Alternatively, use full cream/whole milk if half-and-half is unavailable.*

- **2 tablespoons of prebiotic fiber**  
  *Choose one of the following:*
  - Organic unmodified potato starch
  - Organic pure inulin powder
  - Prebio Plus (a custom blend of organic prebiotic fibers)

- **10 tablets of BioGaia Gastrus, crushed**  
  *Alternatively, use 1/3 cup of L. reuteri yogurt from a previous batch.*

## Equipment

- Luvele yogurt maker (or another yogurt maker capable of maintaining 36°C/97°F)
- Glass jar with lid (provided with the yogurt maker)
- Mortar and pestle or another method to crush tablets
- Mixing bowl and spoon
- Measuring cups and spoons

## Instructions

1. **Sterilize Equipment**  
   Sterilize the glass jar, lid, and any utensils by immersing them in boiling water. This step is crucial to prevent contamination by unwanted bacteria.

2. **Prepare the Probiotic Starter**  
   - If using BioGaia Gastrus tablets, crush 10 tablets into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or another suitable method.
   - If using yogurt from a previous batch, measure out 1/3 cup.

3. **Create the Prebiotic Slurry**  
   - In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of your chosen prebiotic fiber with 1/3 cup of milk.
   - Mix thoroughly to form a smooth, lump-free slurry.

4. **Combine Ingredients**  
   - Add the crushed probiotic tablets (or 1/3 cup of yogurt from a previous batch) to the slurry and mix well.
   - Pour the remaining milk into the sterilized glass jar.
   - Add the slurry mixture to the milk in the jar and stir gently to combine.

5. **Set Up for Fermentation**  
   - Secure the lid on the jar and place it into the yogurt maker.
   - Fill the base of the yogurt maker with water up to the indicated "tall line."
   - Place the cover lid on top of the yogurt maker.

6. **Fermentation Process**  
   - Set the yogurt maker to maintain a temperature of 36°C (97°F).
   - Set the timer for 36 hours to allow for proper fermentation.

7. **Post-Fermentation Handling**  
   - After 36 hours, carefully remove the jar from the yogurt maker.
   - Note: The yogurt may appear runny or separated; this is normal.
   - Do not stir the yogurt while it is warm.

8. **Refrigeration**  
   - Place the jar in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours to allow the yogurt to set and thicken.

9. **Serving and Storage**  
   - Once chilled, the yogurt is ready to eat.
   - Reserve 1/3 cup of this batch to use as a starter for your next batch.
   - For best results, limit re-inoculation to 4–5 times before starting a new batch with fresh BioGaia Gastrus tablets.

## Notes

- **Milk Selection**: Half-and-half is recommended for its fat content, which contributes to a creamier texture. If unavailable, full cream or whole milk can be used.
- **Prebiotic Fiber**: Adding prebiotic fiber serves as food for the L. reuteri bacteria, promoting their growth during fermentation.
- **Consistency**: The final yogurt may vary in thickness. Separation into curds and whey is normal; both components contain beneficial bacteria and should be consumed.
- **Flavor Enhancements**: After fermentation and refrigeration, you may add sweeteners like stevia or Swerve, fresh berries, or keto-friendly granola to taste.
