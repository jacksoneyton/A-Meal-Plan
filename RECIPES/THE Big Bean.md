## 💡 Tips
Bean Preparation: If using canned beans, rinse and drain them before adding. Reduce pressure cooking time to 10 minutes.​
Texture Variation: For a thicker stew, mash some of the cooked vegetables before serving.​

Flavor Enhancement: Adding a splash of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar before serving can brighten the flavors.
